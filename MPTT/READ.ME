The purpose of this project is to Build a simple Django server that
uses MPTT models from django-mptt to create a Dropbox-esque web 
interface where you can create "folders" and "files" in an arbitrary
structure and then display that structure.

To setup project, run the following in Terminal:
pipenv install 
pipenv shell
python manage.py runserver
